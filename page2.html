<p>This first project was one of my first, it was about a new thing I got
  into over the summer. i fell in love with quad/ atv riding because i found
  my dads 2002 trx 300 ex honda quad in my old shed 
  it was siting there like that for about 21 years. 
  But it was safe and covered so
  it didnt loose much. i took it to a mechanic and got it fixed for about $220 
  and now ive been in love
  with it since. so i made a website about quad renting and riding for parties 
  and etc.

I have a scond website about the history of chicken nuggets. it was a practice website 
that was assigned to me by a teacher. we had to choose a food to right about 
and i didnt have much of a favrite so i just chose chicken nugget because
 there popular and everyone know what they are.
